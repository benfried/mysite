I thought it might be useful to me, and hopefully to other, if I had a
place where I could record and share the occasional update or thought.

Lately I've been trying to write down my reactions to the movies I saw
at the New York Film Festival. I'm already way behind --- I made it to 17
movies over two weeks --- but I'm trying to both process my feelings
about the movies and turn that into notes here.

This whole thing is a big personal experiment, so expect it to change.
